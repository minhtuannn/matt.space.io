Based on the paper, the difference between **off-policy actor-critic** and **stochastic actor-critic** methods can be summarized as follows:

### 1. **Off-Policy Actor-Critic (DPG)**:
- **Behavior Policy**: Uses a stochastic policy for exploration (e.g., noise added to actions).
- **Target Policy**: Learns a **deterministic policy** for exploitation.
- **Learning**: Learns off-policy, meaning it learns the deterministic target policy using data collected from a different exploratory behavior policy.

### 2. **Stochastic Actor-Critic**:
- **Policy**: Uses a **stochastic policy** for both exploration and exploitation.
- **Learning**: Typically on-policy, meaning the same stochastic policy is used for both generating actions and learning the policy.

### Key Differences:
- **Off-policy** decouples exploration and exploitation, while **stochastic** methods rely on a single stochastic policy for both.
- DPG is more sample-efficient in high-dimensional action spaces due to the deterministic target policy.


### Differences Between Off-Policy Actor-Critic (DPG) vs. Stochastic Policy Gradient Theorems:

1. **Action Selection**:
   - **Off-Policy Actor-Critic (DPG)**: Uses a deterministic target policy \( \mu_\theta(s) \) and learns off-policy using exploratory data from a different stochastic behavior policy.
   - **Stochastic Policy Gradient**: Uses a stochastic policy \( \pi_\theta(a|s) \) for both exploration and exploitation.

2. **Policy Gradient**:
   - **DPG**: Policy gradient is computed as \( \nabla_\theta J(\mu_\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho^\mu} [\nabla_\theta \mu_\theta(s) \nabla_a Q^\mu(s, a)] \), integrating only over the state space.
   - **Stochastic Policy Gradient**: Includes integration over both state and action spaces \( \nabla_\theta J(\pi_\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{s \sim \rho^\pi, a \sim \pi_\theta} [\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a|s) Q^\pi(s, a)] \).

3. **Sample Efficiency**:
   - **DPG**: More sample-efficient, especially in high-dimensional action spaces, as it avoids integrating over the action space.
   - **Stochastic Policy Gradient**: Typically requires more samples because the gradient involves integrating over both states and actions.

4. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
   - **DPG**: Separates exploration (via stochastic behavior policy) and exploitation (via deterministic target policy).
   - **Stochastic Policy Gradient**: The same stochastic policy is used for both exploration and exploitation, making exploration dependent on the policyâ€™s variance.

In summary, **DPG** is more efficient in high-dimensional spaces and decouples exploration and exploitation, while **stochastic policy gradient** methods are more straightforward but computationally heavier in large action spaces.
