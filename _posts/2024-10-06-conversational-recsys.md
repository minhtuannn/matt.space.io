# Architecture of a Conversational Recommender System

When user preferences change over time, traditional recommendation models often struggle to keep up. They face limitations in quickly adapting to evolving interests, leading to inaccuracies in real-world applications. To address these challenges, a combination of Conversational Components and Recommender Components has been developed, resulting in the Conversational Recommendation System (CRS).

### What is a Conversational Recommendation System?

A Conversational Recommendation System integrates conversational interactions with recommendation processes to continuously build and refine user preferences and item attributes. The system engages users through dialogue, asking questions or suggesting items until the user either finds what they like or exits the session.

### How Does It Work?

The CRS operates in three main stages:

1. **Estimation**:  
   The system builds predictive models that define user preferences and item attributes based on the initial interactions.
   
2. **Action**:  
   Using the estimation results and conversation history, the system decides whether to ask more questions about specific attributes or recommend items. This decision is made through a dialogue policy that aims to balance exploration and recommendation.

3. **Reflection**:  
   If the user rejects the suggested items, the system updates the recommendation model to better align with the user’s preferences and improve future suggestions.

### Key Features and Workflow of CRS

The CRS can be applied to various tasks such as document representation and recommending items (e.g., movies) for users with no prior history (cold-start problem). Its main workflow is structured as follows:

1. **Session-Based Interaction**:  
   The CRS session consists of multiple interaction rounds. In each round, the system either asks the user about specific item attributes or recommends a list of items based on previous responses.

2. **Multi-Round Conversations**:  
   Each round involves the interplay between the **Conversational Component (CC)**, which interacts directly with the user, and the **Recommender Component (RC)**, which estimates user preferences and generates recommendation lists.

3. **Minimizing Interactions**:  
   The goal is to find desirable items while minimizing the number of interactions needed, thereby enhancing the user experience.

### Interaction Between Conversational Component (CC) and Recommender Component (RC)

1. **What Attributes to Ask**:  
   The CC must choose attributes that are likely to match user interests, aiming to narrow down the list of potential items quickly.

2. **When to Recommend Items**:  
   Recommendations should be made when:
   - The list of potential items is small enough.
   - Asking additional questions is unlikely to provide further valuable insights.
   - The RC is confident that the recommendation will be accepted by the user.

3. **Adapting to User Feedback**:  
   After each interaction, the user’s feedback (Yes/No or Accept/Reject) is used to update the model:
   - **Yes/No Feedback for CC**:  
     - **Yes**: Update user profile and item candidates to refine future suggestions.  
     - **No**: Adjust the conversation strategy accordingly.
   - **Accept/Reject Feedback for RC**:  
     - **Reject**: Update the recommendation model to incorporate this negative feedback and improve future suggestions.

### Estimation-Action-Reflection (EAR) Framework

The interaction between CC and RC is driven by the **Estimation-Action-Reflection (EAR)** framework:

1. **Estimation**:  
   The RC ranks candidate items and attributes to guide the CC’s next action.

2. **Action**:  
   Based on the ranked candidates and the conversation history, the CC decides whether to ask more questions or make a recommendation.

3. **Reflection**:  
   If the recommendation is rejected, the RC updates its estimations and strategies for future sessions.

### Detailed Workflow of Each Stage

#### Stage 1: Estimation

In this stage, the CC and RC work together to establish user preferences:

- **CC**: Poses questions to collect information about user preferences.
- **RC**: Uses the gathered information to refine item suggestions and attribute predictions. The CC then leverages these predictions to ask targeted questions that efficiently uncover user preferences.

#### Stage 2: Action

Once user information is collected, the system decides on the next course of action:

- **State Vector Calculation**:  
   The interaction history between CC and RC is encoded into vectors, each capturing an assumption about which attribute might be most useful or whether it’s a good time to recommend items.

- **Policy Network and Reward System**:  
   The CC uses a policy network to decide on actions. Each action (asking a question or recommending items) receives immediate feedback from the user, influencing the policy. The goal is to select actions that maximize the likelihood of finding desirable items with minimal interaction.

#### Stage 3: Reflection

If a recommendation is rejected, the RC model is updated to better reflect the user’s preferences. In conversational scenarios, such rejection feedback is an explicit signal that indicates the user’s dislikes and can be used to significantly improve future recommendations.

### Summary

The Conversational Recommender System aims to effectively combine conversation and recommendation to create a dynamic and adaptable user experience. By engaging users through dialogue and continuously learning from their feedback, CRS can better understand user preferences and provide more accurate and satisfying recommendations.

The core interactions between the Conversational Component and the Recommender Component revolve around the **Estimation-Action-Reflection (EAR)** framework, making CRS a powerful tool for enhancing personalized recommendations in various contexts.
