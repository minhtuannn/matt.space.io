Xin chào,

I'm Minh Tuấn (Matt), a Machine Learning Engineer with over 5 years of experience in Computer Science. My career journey started in Business Intelligence, moved through Data Analysis, and has now focused on Machine Learning Engineering for the past 3 years. 

I hold dual bachelor's degrees—one in Economics and the other in Computer Science, both with strong academic performance.

I've published several posts sharing my experiences, insights, and thoughts on my work, research papers, and emerging technologies in Computer Science and Recommendation Systems. Recently, I’ve been delving deeper into applying Reinforcement Learning in Recommendation Systems at my current job, gaining valuable hands-on experience in this area.

In my free time, I enjoy playing badminton, swimming, kayaking, and hitting the gym.

I’m best reached through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minh-tuan-45a116123/). I’m always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
